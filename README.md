# VisioTec ROS Packages

[ROS] (Kinetic and Melodic) packages developed at the VisioTec research group, CTI Renato Archer, Brazil. Further information about this group can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/geraldofsilveira/talks#TOC-Project-VISIOTEC-in-5-slides).

## Documentation and Citing ##

The technical report available [here](https://github.com/lukscasanova/vtec/blob/master/vtec_ibgho_TR.pdf) describes the underlying algorithm and its working principles. If you use this software, please cite the technical report using:

```
@TechReport{nogueira2019,
  author = {Lucas Nogueira and Ely de Paiva and Geraldo Silveira},
  title  = {Visio{T}ec robust intensity-based homography optimization software},
  number = {CTI-VTEC-TR-01-19},
  institution = {CTI},

}
```


## Installation ##

These packages were tested both on ROS Kinetic with Ubuntu 16.04, and on ROS Melodic with Ubuntu 18.04.

### Dependencies ###

Install the usb_cam driver from ROS repositories.

```
sudo apt-get install ros-[kinetic|melodic]-usb-cam
```

### Build ###
Setup a ROS workspace.

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
```

Install the VisioTec Library. It is a standalone cpp library, non-ROS.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/lukscasanova/vtec.git
cd vtec
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Install the ROS packages

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/lukscasanova/vtec_ros.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Nodes ##

### ibgho_tracker_node ###

Tracks a planar object in an image sequence.

#### Subscribed Topics

* **`camera/image`** ([sensor_msgs/Image])

   The incoming image stream from the camera.

#### Published Topics

* **`annotated_image`** ([sensor_msgs/Image])

   The image stream annotaded with the tracked image region and the score.

* **`stabilized_image`** ([sensor_msgs/Image])

   The warped image patch from the image stream, that tries to match to the reference image patch.

* **`reference_image`** ([sensor_msgs/Image])

   The reference template extracted from the reference image file.   

* **`tracking`** ([vtec_tracker/TrackingResult])

   Information about the tracking, including the estimated homography and the quality score.

#### Parameters

* **`image_topic`** (string, default: "usb_cam/image_raw")

   The name of the image input topic.

* **`bbox_pos_x`** (int, default: 200)

   The x coordinate of the upper left corner of the region of interest in the reference image.

* **`bbox_pos_y`** (int, default: 150)

   The y coordinate of the upper left corner of the region of interest in the reference image.

* **`bbox_size_x`** (int, default: 200)

   The length in pixels of the region of interest along the x direction.

* **`bbox_size_x`** (int, default: 200)

   The length in pixels of the region of interest along the y direction.

* **`max_nb_iter_per_level`** (int, default: 5)

   Maximum number of optimization iterations per pyramid level.

* **`max_nb_pyr_level`** (int, default: 2)

   Maximum number of pyramids levels.

* **`sampling_rate`** (double, default: 1.0)

   The sampling rate used to sample points used in the optimization process. 1.0 means 100% of the points are used.

* **`homography_type`** (string, default: "full")

   Specifies the type of homography to be considered by the optimization algorithm. The options are: "full", "affine" and "stretch".

* **`robust_flag`** (bool, default: "false")

    Set this to true to enable robust mode. This will try to detect partial occlusions on the current image and discard that information from the estimation procedure.

## Usage ##

### Running with a dataset ###

#### Newspaper Dataset ####

Download the dataset from here: [newspaper dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kxv9ahrxhvgebja/vtec_test_tracker.bag?dl=0)

Open two terminal windows, and launch in the first one the tracker node with:

```
roslaunch vtec_tracker tracker.launch
```

In the other terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the dataset, decompress and play the bagfile with:

```
rosbag decompress vtec_test_tracker.bag
rosbag play vtec_test_tracker.bag
```

Now you should see in RViz the tracking process using the default parameters from the launch file.

#### Theater Dataset ####

Download the dataset from here: [theater dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hjbxhzb4k54ff9a/vtec_tracker_theater.bag?dl=0)

Open two terminal windows, and launch in the first one the tracker node with:

```
roslaunch vtec_tracker tracker.launch config_file:=config_theater.yaml
```

In the other terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the dataset, decompress and play the bagfile with:

```
rosbag decompress vtec_tracker_theater.bag
rosbag play vtec_tracker_theater.bag
```

Now you should see in RViz the tracking process using the default parameters from the launch file.


#### Occlusion Dataset ####

Download the dataset from here: [occlusion dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1gq836jblnuagw2/vtec_occlusion.bag?dl=0)

Open two terminal windows, and launch in the first one the tracker node with:

```
roslaunch vtec_tracker tracker.launch config_file:=config_robust.yaml
```

In the other terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the dataset, decompress and play the bagfile with:

```
rosbag decompress vtec_occlusion.bag
rosbag play vtec_occlusion.bag
```

Now you should see in RViz the tracking process using the parameters from the launch file.




### Running from a live camera ###

Open a terminal window and launch the tracker node:

```
roslaunch vtec_tracker tracker_live.launch
```

A Rviz window will pop-up with the camera images. In the terminal window where you issued the roslaunch command, press the **S** key to start tracking. This will select a bounding box in the current frame to be tracked. You can press **S** again anytime to restart the tracking process.
